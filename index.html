                <p>Pandemonium is a Entity in the roblox game pressure. Very Very Hard to counter beacuase unlike the other anglers,
                    Pandemonium is able to see you from very far away. the best way to count Pandemonium is to either stay completly out of Pandemonium's line of sight.
                    if you can't see Pandemonium, Pandemonium can't see you. Another way is to fight Pandemonium in his own minigame. Enter a locker and start playing.
                    keep your mouse in the middle and Pandemonium will go by without any harm to you. Mini game hard, dont underestimate Pandemonium's strength.
